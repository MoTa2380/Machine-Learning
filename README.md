This course provides a introduction to the fundamental concepts and techniques in Machine Learning.

### Course Topics:
1. **Univariate Probability**: Introduction to probability theory with a focus on univariate distributions and their applications in machine learning.
2. **Multivariate Probability**: Extension to multivariate distributions, exploring joint, marginal, and conditional probabilities.
3. **Statistics**: Key statistical concepts and methods essential for data analysis and model evaluation in machine learning, such as Maximum Likelihood and Maximum A Posteriori (MAP).
4. **Linear Algebra**: Fundamental linear algebra concepts crucial for understanding machine learning models, including vectors, matrices, and transformations.
5. **Logistic Regression**: Overview of logistic regression, a foundational classification algorithm, and its applications.
6. **Optimization**: Techniques for optimizing machine learning models, with a focus on gradient-based optimization methods.
7. **Discriminant Analysis**: A statistical approach to classification, covering both Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) and Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA).
8. **Linear Regression**: Introduction to linear regression models for predicting continuous outcomes, with a focus on least-squares estimation.
9. **MultiLayer Perceptron (MLP)**: Exploration of artificial neural networks, focusing on the structure and learning algorithms of MLPs.
10. **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**: Introduction to CNNs, a specialized neural network architecture for image recognition and other structured data.
11. **Kernel Methods**: Discussion on kernel-based learning methods, including support vector machines (SVMs) and other kernel tricks.
12. **Dimensionality Reduction**: Techniques for reducing the dimensionality of data while retaining important features, such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and t-SNE.
